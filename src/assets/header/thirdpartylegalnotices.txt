                       The FreeType Project LICENSE
                      ----------------------------
  
                              2006-Jan-27
  
                      Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
            David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



  Introduction
  ============

    The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
    some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
    various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
    FreeType Project.
  
    This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
    which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
    affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
    documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
  
    This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
    (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
    and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
    alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

      o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
        interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 
      o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
        full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
  
      o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
        it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
        somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
        FreeType code. (`credits')
  
    We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
    software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
    We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
    assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


    Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
    credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
    encourage you to use the following text:

     """
      Portions of this software are copyright � <year> The FreeType
      Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
     """

    Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
    actually use.


  Legal Terms
  ===========

  0. Definitions
  --------------

    Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
    and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
    distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
    Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
    beta or final release.
  
    `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
    `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
    code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
    This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
    engine'.

    This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
    FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
    documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
    original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
    If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
    this license, you must contact us to verify this.

    The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
    Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
    specified below.

Pango

  Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
  on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
  is needed; however, most of the work on Pango so far has been done using 
  the GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
  and font handling for GTK+-2.x.

  Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used
  with different font backends. There are three basic backends, with
  multiple options for rendering with each.

   - Client side fonts using the FreeType and fontconfig libraries.
     Rendering can be with with Cairo or Xft libraries, or directly
     to an in-memory buffer with no additional libraries.

   - Native fonts on Microsoft Windows using Uniscribe for complex
     script handling. Rendering can be done via Cairo or directly
     using the native Win32 API.

   - Native fonts on MacOS X with the CoreText framework, rendering via
     Cairo.

  The integration of Pango with Cairo (http://cairographics.org)
  provides a complete solution with high quality text handling 
  and graphics rendering.

  Dynamically loaded modules then handle text layout for particular
  combinations of script and font backend.

  As well as the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes
  PangoLayout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,
  and routines to assist in editing internationalized text.

  For more information about Pango, see:

   http://www.pango.org/

  Dependencies
  ============

  Pango depends on the GLib library; more information about GLib can
  be found at http://www.gtk.org/.

  To use the Free Software stack backend, Pango depends on the following
  libraries:

    * fontconfig for font discovery (http://www.fontconfig.org),

    * FreeType for font access (http://www.freetype.org),

    * HarfBuzz for complex text shaping (http://www.harfbuzz.org/)

  Cairo support depends on the Cairo library (http://cairographics.org).
  The Cairo backend is the preferred backend to use Pango with and is
  subject of most of the development in the future.  It has the
  advantage that the same code can be used for display and printing.

  We suggest using Pango with Cairo as described above, but you can also
  do X-specific rendering using the Xft library. The Xft backend uses
  version 2 of the Xft library to manage client side fonts. Version 2 of
  Xft is available from http://xlibs.freedesktop.org/release/.  You'll
  need the libXft package, and possibly the libXrender and renderext
  packages as well.  You'll also need fontconfig (see below.)

  Installation of Pango on Win32 is possible, but is not documented
  here. See http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html

  Notes
  =====

   - By default, Pango tries to build itself so that no explicit
     dependency on Xft or FreeType will be introduced in apps that
     link to Pango. This is to avoid compatibility problems with
     changes in the Xft or FreeType API's or ABI's. Specifying 
     --enable-explicit-deps or --enable-static when configuring Pango 
     will defeat this and should be avoided if possible.

  License
  =======

  Most of the code of Pango is licensed under the terms of the 
  GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) - see the file COPYING for details.

  The OpenType code in pango/opentype is derived from the FreeType 
  project (http://www.freetype.org) and is dual-licensed under the 
  GNU General Public License and the FreeType license. See see
  pango/opentype/FT-license.txt for full details of the FreeType 
  license.

  Note that binary distributions of Pango must include a disclaimer 
  that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, 
  in the distribution documentation; for instance, by including this 
  README file.

MyThes

  MyThes is a simple thesaurus that uses a structured
  text data file and an index file with binary search
  to lookup words and phrases and return information
  on part of speech, meanings, and synonyms
  
  MyThes was originall written to provide a thesaurus
  for the OpenOffice.org project 
  
  The Main features of MyThes are:
  
  1. written in C++ to make it easier to interface with 
     LibreOffice, OpenOffice, AbiWord, Pspell, etc
  
  2. it is stateless, uses no static variables and
     should be completely reentrant with no ifdefs  
  
  3. it compiles with -ansi and -pedantic and -Wall
     with no warnigns so it shouldbe quite portable
  
  4. it uses a simple perl program to read the structured
     text file and create the index needed for binary
     searching
  
  5. it is very simple with *lots* of comments.
     The main "smarts" are in the structure of the
     text file that makes up the thesaurus data
  
  6. It comes with a ready-to-go structured thesaurus
     data file for en_US extracted from the WordNet-2.0 data.
  
     Please see WordNet_license.txt and WordNet_readme.txt
     for more information on the very useful project!
  
     See http://www.danielnaber.de/wn2ooo/ for utilities to
     regenerate an up to date English thesaurus from the most
     recent WordNet data.
     
  7. The source code has a BSD license (and no advertising clause)
  
  
  MyThes comes with a simple example program that looks up some words and returns
  meanings and synonyms.
  
  To build it simply do the following:
  
  unzip mythes.zip
  cd mythes
  ./configure
  make
  
  To run the example program:
  ./example th_en_US_new.idx th_en_US_new.dat checkme.lst
  
  To run the example program with stemming and morphological generation:
  e.g. to check mouse, mice, rodents, eats, eaten, ate, eating etc. words
  ./example morph.idx morph.dat morph.lst morph.aff morph.dic
  
  NOTE: this is only an example and test environment for dictionary developers,
  full English stemming and morphological generation needs an improved
  English Hunspell dictionary.

金山PDF中使用的开源软件
一、Freetype
Copyright ©1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg

（一）Introduction
The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the FreeType Project.
This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license affects thus the FreeType font engine，the  test  programs,documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
This  license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence,its main points are that:
1.We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (‘as is’distribution)
2.You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (‘royalty-free'usage)
3.You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the freetype code.(‘credits’)
We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications,in commercial products.We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project  and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  acredit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:
Portions of this software are copyright ©The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.Please replace  with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
（二）Legal Terms
0.Definitions

Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project',and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, andWerner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,beta or final release.
You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
The FreeType Project is copyright ©1996-2000 by David Turner,Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.
1.No Warranty

THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
2. Redistribution

This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:
Redistribution of source code must retain this license file(`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered,original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files.
If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.
3. Advertising

Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.
We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine',`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.
4. Contacts

There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

freetype@nongnu.org

Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

freetype-devel@nongnu.org

Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues,specific licenses, porting, etc.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
